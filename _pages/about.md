I am a drug discovery scientist working specialised in computational chemistry techniques that leverage *in silico* algorithms for physicochemical property predictions. I am currently based in Leiden, The Netherlands where I work asynchronously as a postdoctoral research fellow for ASAP discovery and the Chodera lab in New York, USA. I am interested primarily in early-stage drug discovery - I am further exploring this within the ASAP Discovery Consortium.
