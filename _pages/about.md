I am drug discovery scientist working specialised in computational chemistry techniques that leverage *in silico* algorithms for physicochemical property predictions. I am currently based in Leiden (The Netherlands) where I work asynchronously as a senior computational scientist for ASAP discovery and the Chodera lab in New York, USA. I am interested primarily in physics-based computational modeling for early-stage drug discovery - I am further exploring this within the ASAP Discovery Consortium.
