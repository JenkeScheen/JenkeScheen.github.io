I am a drug discovery scientist working specialised in computational chemistry techniques that leverage *in silico* algorithms for physicochemical property predictions. I am currently based in Leiden, The Netherlands where I work asynchronously as a postdoctoral research fellow for ASAP discovery and the Chodera lab in New York, USA. I am interested primarily in early-stage drug discovery - I am further exploring this within the ASAP Discovery Consortium.

Originally from The Netherlands I have lived in France and the United Kingdom for research purposes. Currently I live in Leiden with my partner and our chonky cat Cosmo :cat2:. Beside science I often go long-distance running :running:, playing football :soccer: and hiking :sunrise_over_mountains:. I love cooking and experimenting with new ingredients - I often do fermentation and dry-ageing experiments at home that usually result in non-toxic dishes.
