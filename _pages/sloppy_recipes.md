This page is a personal reference repository for recipes. I don't generally follow step-by-step recipes and don't really like writing them - instead, these recipes will consist of loosely constructed descriptions that can be pieced together.

<summary>Pizza dough</summary>
This is an evolving recipe for pizza dough that I use on a weekly basis. Make sure you purchase good 00 flour, I try to buy from local flour mills in bulk. I use the handy app `PizzApp` to calculate measurements based on the number of people attending.


### Ingredients
(for 1 dough ball at 65% hydration)

Poolish:
- 44g flour
- 44g water
- 0.008g ID yeast (fresh is okay but have not noticed a significant difference and is perishable)

Bulk ferment:
- 146g flour
- 80g water
- 0.74g ID yeast
- 5.7g salt (high-Q fine sea salt)
- 50/50 mix of flour/fine semolina for dusting


### General method
t-2 days make poolish by mixing flour, water and yeast, no kneading needed. Cover with cling film and let sit at RT until ready to make bulk dough. 48h is ideal.

\~7h before serving pizza, add fermented poolish to the bulk ferment's flour, water and ID yeast and mix until combined; let sit for \~30 min (this is called "autolyse", results in a softer end-product). Knead (best to use a machine) until enough gluten has developed (google windowpane technique), then add all salt and knead until fully absorbed. When finished kneading, weigh the complete mass of dough and divide by the number of intended dough balls (n=1 in this recipe of course). Divide into balls (dough scraper is useful here), roll up into tight balls (see youtube) and place in fermentation box lightly dusted with semolina mixture. Let ferment for 6-7 hours. 


Pizza making itself is best learned off youtube videos, but a pizza stone/steel is the bare minimum equipment for getting reasonable pizzas.
