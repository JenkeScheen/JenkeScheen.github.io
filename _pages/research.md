I have a background in biochemistry ([bio-pharmaceutical sciences](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/bio-pharmaceutical-sciences) at Leiden University) which was mostly focussed on toxicology, computational chemistry and [science-based business](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/science-based-business). During this period I worked at the [Van Westen](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=H7farnwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [IJzerman](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1182-2259) group on a project that involved virtual screening of metabolic targets in breast cancer; beside virtual screening applications I coordinated purchasing and *in vitro* validation of screening hits. 

After a brief period working at the group of [Didier Rognan](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=6tao8_0AAAAJ&hl=fr) in Strasbourg, France, on PPIs, pharmacophore screening and pocket similarity analyses I moved on to do a PhD with [Julien Michel](https://www.julienmichel.net/lab/) in Edinburgh, UK. Here I explored oppportunities in interfacing alchemical free energy calculations and machine-learning applications for drug design. 

Currently I am working with [John Chodera](https://www.choderalab.org/) as a postdoctoral research fellow for [ASAP discovery](https://asapdiscovery.org/) and the [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) in New York, USA employed through the Open Molecular Software Foundation ([OMSF](https://omsf.io/)). This global effort is aimed at drug discovery for pandemic preparedness by creating pipelines for accessible/ equitable antivirals. I act as a science liaison for computational chemistry core of ASAP and coordinate the majority of ongoing research in this group. I am also in charge of running exascale alchemical free energy calculations on [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en-GB) as project support for ASAP; I interface with all other cores (medicinal chemistry, structural biology, biochemical assays, etc) and pursue areas where computational chemistry can be leveraged within ASAP. I collaborate on a daily basis with instances such as [Diamond Light source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home.html) (Oxford, UK), [PostEra](https://postera.ai/) (Boston, MA, USA), [MedChemica](https://www.medchemica.com/) (Manchester, UK), the [Weizmann Institute](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/) (Tel Aviv, Israel), the [DNDi](https://dndi.org/) (Geneva, Switzerland) and [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/) (CA, USA), among others.
